# Wordle-solver

In this notebook, we find the solution of the daily English Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

In every iteration they tell you the best word to use, and you have to input the results, the colors. (Green='G', Yellow='Y', Gray='B').

The datasets with the list of words have been obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bcruise/wordle-valid-words.
